// The semantic system for representing a "copy" when a source and destination
// both agree on an exact wire format that represents the `source`.
//
// Flowing a copy allows making an observation of that representation and
// storing it in a format provided by the destination receiver. This is often
// modeled as a `memmove` but the semantics are defined by the TTX transport used
// to perform the flow.
class Copy {
 public:
  // Records an observation of the Flow's bound source in the target storage.
  // Success means that storage contains the promised wire form at the requested
  // observation point. Future observations may differ: copying into a and then
  // b can produce different values even when both calls use the same Flow and
  // both return Success.
  //
  // The returned Data status answers whether the whole observation succeeded.
  // On failure the target may have changed, but no partial result is certified.
  //
  // The target storage's fit is always validated before performing the flow
  // and must fit the flow's required destination representation. Overlapping
  // Fragment reflow has an unspecified combined result and supplies no snapshot
  // promise.
  //
  // The form fixes the location and extent of padding, but not its byte values.
  // Direct access copies those bytes with the record, while Fragment writes
  // only primitive positions. Both satisfy the same promised observation.
