// Flow establishes one synchronous access agreement between already
// bootstrapped Queries. Direct, Shared, Block and Fragment are independent
// contracts tried in that preference order. The first compatible pair wins,
// and the host retains only that protocol's state for later operations.
//
// The reader needs no target Storage during establishment. Each operation can
// supply its own storage without negotiating again. The opaque handle keeps
// the host's local protocol union out of the foreign module's C
// representation.

// own storage later. The query and its Flows borrow the representation, so its

//
// BindingPending reports that the owner cannot yet answer this bind request.
// No work continues after return, and retry belongs to the caller. Rejection
// also stops negotiation. Once a protocol is selected, an acquisition failure
// cannot silently choose a different agreement. Endpoint state, representations
// and implementation code remain borrowed throughout subsequent Flow use.
