// without adding an acquisition or release to every use. The publication must
// therefore keep the representation valid for all of those readers.
//
// View describes the ABI the reader accepts. Access supplies its representation
// and the public pointer that satisfies it. Agreement grants a cast of that
// pointer to the described C representation, not a cast of either binding's
// source. This lets the provider keep unrelated state behind its thunks while
// exposing just the representation it chose to publish. No destination Storage
// is needed to establish that agreement.
